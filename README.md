# Pull Before You Push
You are asked to pull before you push, because someone pushed changes to the 
server, after your last pull, so our local copy and the current server copy 
are not in sync. Pulling will merge the remote copy with your local one, 
which brings them back into sync and allows you to push.

The reason that you are not allowed to push straight away, is that this will 
need merging and might lead to conflicts which need manual resolving.
